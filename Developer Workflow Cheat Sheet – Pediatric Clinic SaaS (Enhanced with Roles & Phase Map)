# Developer Workflow Cheat Sheet – Pediatric Clinic SaaS (Enhanced with Roles & Phase Map)

This document is a **high-standard, developer-ready workflow guide** for building the Pediatric Clinic / Clinic Operations SaaS using **ChatGPT + VS Code + Phase-Based Vibe Coding**, now with a **role + phase + doc map**.

---

## 1️⃣ Project Setup

1. Clone Git repo and open in VS Code
2. Verify folder structure (`/src/backend`, `/src/frontend`, `/docs`, etc.)
3. Install dependencies and connect Git + CI/CD
4. Open ChatGPT extension / browser for AI assistance

---

## 2️⃣ AI Usage & Rules (`claude.md`)

* Assign a role before giving instructions:

```
You are now operating as [ROLE]: Backend Architect / Frontend Engineer / QA / Product Architect
```

* Follow **claude.md rules**: no features outside PRD, no skipping phases, respect RBAC, stop & ask if unclear

---

## 3️⃣ Phase-Based Development (`tasks.md`)

* Follow **tasks.md phases**:

  * Phase 0: Validation & Setup
  * Phase 1: Core Foundation
  * Phase 2: Critical Paths
  * Phase 3: UX Completion
  * Phase 4: Hardening
  * Phase 5: Pre-launch QA
  * Phase 6: Launch
  * Phase 7: Future Pediatric Enhancements
* Update **decisions.md** and **risks.md** after each phase
* Verify exit criteria before moving on

---

## 4️⃣ Decisions & Risks

### decisions.md

* Record choices, alternatives rejected, owner, and date

### risks.md

* Log risks, severity, and mitigation

---

## 5️⃣ AI-Assisted Coding

* AI generates **code snippets, config, and UI scaffolding** per phase and role
* Human reviews and merges
* Maintain QA / Breaker checks for security, data integrity, UX, and tenant safety

---

## 6️⃣ QA / Breaker Role

* Test invalid inputs, permission bypasses, multi-tenant isolation
* Log all issues in **risks.md**

---

## 7️⃣ Launch Readiness

* Confirm Phase 6 exit criteria
* Deploy to pilot tenants
* Monitor metrics and collect feedback
* Update **decisions.md** and **risks.md**

---

```

* Top-down flow: PRD → Claude → Tasks → AI → Human → Decisions → Risks → QA → Next Phase
* AI acts only after **role assignment & task scope**
* Decisions & risks updated continuously
* Repeat per phase until launch
