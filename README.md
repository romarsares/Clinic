# Clinic SaaS

Clinic SaaS is a multi-tenant software-as-a-service platform designed to streamline operations for small and medium-sized clinics (SMEs). It serves as the "operating system" for clinics, replacing chaotic manual processes with structured workflows for appointment management, patient records, consultations, billing, and reporting.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Supports multiple clinics on shared infrastructure with isolated data.
- **User & Role Management**: Hierarchical roles (Owner, Doctor, Staff) with role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Appointment Management**: Core functionality for scheduling and reducing no-shows.
- **Patient Management**: Basic patient identity and history tracking.
- **Consultation Records**: Free-text notes for visits, providing legal protection and operational clarity.
- **Billing Summary**: Tracks charges and payments with simple summaries.
- **Reports**: Owner-focused metrics on revenue, doctor utilization, and no-shows.
- **Audit Logs**: Ensures accountability and builds trust.

## Design Philosophy
- Avoids heavy medical regulations by focusing on operations rather than full EHR.
- Documentation-first approach for faster onboarding and scaling.
- Configurable and adaptable for global markets, starting from the Philippines and expanding to SEA, LATAM, Africa, and beyond.
- Priced affordably (₱999–₱2,999/month) to be more cost-effective than hiring additional staff.
